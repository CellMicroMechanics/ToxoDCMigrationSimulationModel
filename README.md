# Simulation Model for Toxoplasma-infected Dendritic Cell Migration 
A 2-dimensional simulation model for the Toxoplasma-infected dendritic cell migration in a straight channel to study the host-parasite intracellular positioning. 
This repository includes:
1. The LAMMPS software with a customized package for the simulation model.
2. Example results of simulations and videos.
Detailed instructions for running the simulation can be found in ./LAMMPS/src/MYFIX/src/MYFIX/ReadMe.txt.
